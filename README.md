# web3-market-place
### About
This is a front-end project site for a web3 market place. I found the inspiration on dribbble.com and given the extremely cool look of the site, i decided to develop it. 

### Assets
I found the assets on Unsplash, which has this massive resource of free to use images. I came across Unsplash during my period as a graphic designer in college, and it has stayed with me since.
For the logo, I took the colors of the original logo but decided to give the name a spin.
